## Research
I have been working with Adam Leroy and Dyas Utomo as a student researcher in [OSU's Department of Astronomy](https://astronomy.osu.edu/) since 2018. Our project aims to locate supernovae and compare their radial distributions to that of the IR and UV emission of their host galaxies. I conducted part of this project during the Department of Astronomy's [Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP)](https://astronomy.osu.edu/undergraduates/undergraduate-research/surp/alumni) in the summer of 2019. I am also a summer 2020 NSF REU student at the [National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)](https://science.nrao.edu/opportunities/student-programs/summerstudents) in Socorro, New Mexico, where I work with Juergen Ott, David Meier, and Brian Svoboda on probing the molecular gas around Sgr A*. As I am still new to research, my interests span many fields; though I do take special interest in fate of massive stars, their impacts on the interstellar medium, and multi-wavelength observations.

### The Local Environments of Low-Redshift Supernovae

**_Summary._** Supernovae are the explosive deaths of stars. They are crucially important to the buildup of heavy elements in the universe and the growth of galaxies. Core-collapse supernovae are the deaths of high-mass stars, and type Ia supernovae are the explosions of white dwarfs, which are the leftover cores of dead low-mass stars. Beyond these two broad types, many mysteries still surround the origin of supernovae and the details of how they impact their host galaxies. Measuring the locations where supernovae occur allows us to constrain the types of stellar populations that give rise to these explosions and tells us about their likely impact on the surrounding gas and dust. Furthermore, comparing the rate of supernovae to other tracers of star birth, like ultraviolet and infrared emission, allows us to search for consistency between two totally independent indicators of the star formation rate in galaxies. Despite this, few studies have measured the environments where supernovae occur and related them to supernova type. We have carried out the largest such study to date. We measured the local environments of ~1,000 low-redshift historical supernovae, which were drawn from a complete collection of supernovae called the [Open Supernova Catalog](sne.space). We then placed these supernovae into an atlas of ultraviolet and infrared images [(z0MGS)](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/WISE/z0MGS/overview.html), which trace the location of old stars, young stars, and dust in ~16,000 local (d < 50 Mpc) galaxies. Following previous works, we used pixel statistics in order to generate cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of supernova types in relation to the UV and IR emission. The resulting CDFs support the idea that there is a correlation between environment and supernova type. They also show that while type Ia supernovae generally track starlight, core-collapse supernovae tend to track star formation, which is in line with current theories. _Publication in prep._

## Teaching

**ASTRON 1101 Laboratory Sections.** From Spring 2017 - Fall 2018, I was an instructional assistant (IA) for a general education astronomy course at OSU. During the laboratory sessions, I answered questions, facilitated group discussions, and set up teaching demos. Outside of class, I graded weekly lab reports and tutored students.

**ASTRON 1101 Lecture Section.** I am now a teaching assistant (TA) to the lecture section of ASTRON 1101. I help facilitate lecture, grade assignments, proctor and grade exams, and hold office hours for students.
