## Research
I have been working with Adam Leroy and Dyas Utomo as a student researcher in [OSU's Department of Astronomy](https://astronomy.osu.edu/) since 2018. Our project aims to locate supernovae and compare their radial distributions to that of the IR and UV emission of their host galaxies. I conducted part of this project during the Department of Astronomy's [Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP)](https://astronomy.osu.edu/undergraduates/undergraduate-research/surp/alumni) in the summer of 2019. I am also a summer 2020 NSF REU student at the [National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)](https://science.nrao.edu/opportunities/student-programs/summerstudents) in Socorro, New Mexico, where I work with Juergen Ott, David Meier, and Brian Svoboda on probing the molecular gas around Sgr A*. As I am still new to research, my interests span many fields; though I do take special interest in fate of massive stars, their impacts on the interstellar medium, and multi-wavelength observations.
