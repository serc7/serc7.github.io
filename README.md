## Research
I have been working with Adam Leroy and Dyas Utomo as a student researcher in [OSU's Department of Astronomy](https://astronomy.osu.edu/) since 2018. Our project aims to locate supernovae and compare their radial distributions to that of the IR and UV emission of their host galaxies. I conducted part of this project during the Department of Astronomy's [Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP)](https://astronomy.osu.edu/undergraduates/undergraduate-research/surp/alumni) in the summer of 2019. This project was also the topic of my undergraduate senior thesis.

I am also working with Juergen Ott, David Meier, and Brian Svoboda on probing the molecular gas around Sgr A*. I began this work in the summer of 2020 as a (virtual) NSF REU student at the [National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)](https://science.nrao.edu/opportunities/student-programs/summerstudents) in Socorro, New Mexico. I will be continuing this work as an NRAO post-bacc intern in the spring of 2021. As I am still new to research, my interests span many fields; broadly, I take special interest in ISM studies, Galactic and extragalactic astronomy, galaxy evolution, radio astronomy, and multi-wavelength observations.

### The Local Environments and Rates of Low-Redshift Supernovae

**_Summary._** 
We aim to characterize the local (2 kpc) environments of Type Ia, II, and Ibc supernovae (SNe) by measuring the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) emission at SN sites. Measuring the amount of host galaxy emission at SN sites gives insight into their impact on the local environment and allows us to search for consistency between the star formation rate and the SN rate. Starting with an atlas of ~16,000 local  Mpc galaxies, we select a sample of 472 recent SNe from [The Open Supernova Catalog](sne.space). We locate each SN in UV and IR images [(z0MGS)](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/WISE/z0MGS/overview.html) that highlight regions of young stars, old stars, and dust. These images were observed by NASA's GALEX and WISE missions. We seek to test the hypothesis that Type Ia SNe track the starlight of their host galaxies, whereas core-collapse SNe (Type II and Ibc) are tightly linked to regions of young stars and active star formation. Following previous works, we use a pixel statistics method to generate cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of UV and IR emission within a 2 kpc region of the explosion site for each SN type. We find that, generally, Type Ia SNe follow near-IR (W1) light, which traces the total distribution of all stars in a galaxy. Type II SNe are similarly distributed to mid-IR light (W3, W4), which traces dust, and a combination of mid-IR and far-UV (FUV) emission that we expect to trace recent star formation. Type Ib/c SNe appear to also track the dust (W3, W4) of their host galaxies. Taking advantage of our large sample size, we also calculate SN rates in the local Universe. Our estimations of the number of SNe per stellar mass and per SFR correspond to 1.2 - 3.5 SNe per century in the Milky Way.

### Molecular Clouds Toward the Supermassive Black Hole Sgr A\*
We present ∼1 arsec resolution ALMA observations of molecular clouds along the line-of-sight to Sgr A*. We report absorption detections that lead to the placement of 6 velocity features in either the spiral arms, bar, or Galactic Center (GC). We aimed at 18 high-energy molecular transitions in hopes of picking up clouds in the circumnuclear disk (CND) to study the environment around Sgr A\*. For each velocity feature, or cloud, we analyzed its kinematics, chemistry, excitation, and CO isotopologues in order to locate it along our line-of-sight. We place 2 clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), both perhaps in the 100 pc ring and possibly related to the +20 km s−1 and +50 km s−1 molecular clouds. We designate 3 clouds as being in the Galactic Disk, and kinematics suggest they are in the inner Galactic Disk, perhaps around the 3 kpc arm of the bar. We are unable to determine the properties of one of our clouds and thus are not able to speculate about its location. This is due to saturated CO isotopologue data at its velocity. We do not have a current candidate for CND material, though we hope to unveil a candidate by looking at emission features in a future study.

## Teaching

**ASTRON 1101 Laboratory and Lecture Sections.** Since Spring 2017, I have been a teaching assistant (TA) for a general education astronomy course at OSU. During the laboratory sessions, I answer questions, facilitate group discussions, and set up teaching demos. Outside of class, I graded weekly lab reports and tutored students. As a lecture TA, I help facilitate lecture, grade assignments, proctor and grade exams, and hold office hours for students. I also have experience in course development and using Canvas.
